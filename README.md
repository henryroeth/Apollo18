# Typescript Game
You can play the game online from [here](https://cpsc.hiram.edu/)
## Setup

1. On your computer you will need to have several pieces of software installed:

* node.js and npm -- You can download and install from [here](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
* visual studio code -- This is an optional IDE but I recommend it.  It has several built-in features that make it easy for working with TypeScript and Node.  You can download and install from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
* git -- You can download and install from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

You will also need to have an account on [github](https://github.com).

2. Clone this repository to your computer.

To clone this repository run the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/henryroeth/Apollo18.git`

This will create a directory on your computer called **Apollo18** which will contain the contents of this game.

3. Next, you will need to setup all the libraries the game depends on.  Go to the **Apollo18** directory and run the following command to create a **node_modules** directory and install the needed libraries into it.

`npm install`

Your game should be all setup.

If you are using Visual Studio Code, you can open the directory and use the node script to start a web server and monitor changes.  You can also do this from the command line by typing:

npm run-script start
=======
`npm run start`
